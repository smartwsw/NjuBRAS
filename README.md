# NjuBRAS

This is a course project of Mobile Internet Technology(2016 Spring). 

##Main function
- A simple client that used to login BRAS of Nanjing University.
- Local user info saving.
- Quick login via today extension with just a switch!

##Issue remaining
- Layout of the today extension is quite strange while using autolayout.
- "Next" botton of the "username" textfield in the main app does not working correctly. It will dismiss the keyboard instead of swtiching to the next textfield.
- It's likely to lose response when using some function without access to [BRAS Login Page](http://p.nju.edu.cn/). Such as using mobile network or network disabled.

##Others
- It's now temporary finished. But I may add more functions in the future.
